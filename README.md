# Optimized-Data-Acquisition

For the purpose of my Data Analyst's professional training, I worked on optimized data acquisition's solution. BottleNeck is a famous wine vendor. It has plenty of shop across Europe, especially in France which represent at least 50% of sales. 
As freelance Data Analyst, I had to find out relationship between data provided by ERP and CMS and merge in a consistent data structure. 

# 1. Data Clean up

It's the most important part of the solution. Indeed, much of the work consisted in data's manipulation (sorted data, delete unrevelant features, missing values, replace wrong data..). 
So in this part, I have done some quantitative and qualitative analysis to quickly identify relevant data and data to remove. My decision to keep feature or not depending to missing values's proportion and correlated features. 

Then, I checked uniquness on all of my pretending primary-key before merging.  

# 2. Testing Data Requests 

So now, I had all my data correcly merged, I wrote a data request to get annual sales and compare with sale department. 


# 3. Outliers's additional analysis
